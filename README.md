# CloudFormation VPC Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates the creation of a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) using AWS CloudFormation. The CloudFormation template provided sets up a VPC with public and private subnets across multiple Availability Zones, an Internet Gateway, and routing tables, along with an S3 bucket.

## Project Structure

The CloudFormation template included in this project creates the following resources:

- **VPC**: A Virtual Private Cloud with DNS support and hostnames enabled.
- **Subnets**: Public and private subnets spread across two Availability Zones.
  - Public Subnets:
    - PublicSubnet1A
    - PublicSubnet2B
  - Private Subnets:
    - AppPrivateSubnet1A
    - DataPrivateSubnet1A
    - PrivateSubnet2B
    - DataPrivateSubnet2B
- **Internet Gateway**: An Internet Gateway attached to the VPC to allow internet access for the public subnets.
- **Route Tables**: Route tables to manage routing for the public subnets.
- **S3 Bucket**: A bucket for storing project-related data.

## Deployment
To deploy the CloudFormation stack, use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI:

# AWS Managemnet Console
Go to the AWS CloudFormation console.
Click on "Create Stack".
Upload the CloudFormation template.
Follow the prompts to create the stack.
AWS CLI
sh
Copy code
aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name my-vpc-stack --template-body file://path/to/your/template.yaml
